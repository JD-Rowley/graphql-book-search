  ## Description
  This was a fully functioning search engine using Google Books API that was built using a RESTful API. It has been refactored to be a GraphQL API built with Apollo Server. It functions exactly the same, just with a different API.
  ## Installation
  The user needs to navigate to the root directory and enter the command 'npm i' or 'npm install.' This will open the server directory and install its dependencies then move on to the client directory to install its dependencies.
  ## Usage
  This repo no longer uses a RESTful API, rather now it uses an API built with GraphQL. Once the server is started, the user can create an account, log in, and search for books to add to their list. They can then navigate to the saved books page, and view or delete books from their collection.
  ## Contribution Guidelines
  No contributions are being accepted at this time.
  ## Testing
  From the root directory, enter the command 'npm run develop' to start both the GraphQL server and the client-side server.
